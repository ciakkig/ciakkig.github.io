I have **finally** completed my Personal Weather Station project!

This was one of the very first adventures I embarked on when I got into electronics, and after countless years of working on and off this "weekend project", I can finally just sit back, relax, and enjoy my mildly accurate, extremely localised weather data.

As for the build, I've already compiled a complete tutorial on how to make it yourself, and posted it on [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Particle-Photon-IoT-Personal-Weather-Station).
It's presented in a much more thorough, detailed and accessible way there than I could ever put it here, so please do check it out if you're interested.
Moreover, here are quick links to the [software](https://github.com/ciakkig/pws), and here are the [3D models](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4435632).

To my absolute surprise, my Instructable even got featured by the curators!
Thanks to this amazing exposure, it gained more than a thousand views in less than a month ever since -- and counting!

Now, even though I described this project as "completed", I've already got some interesting ideas for future developments...
But I'll have to wait until next year for those.
