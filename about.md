# Hello, this is me! -- 'couple years ago.

### I am a university student, born and raised in Genova, Italy but currently based in Glasgow, Scotland!
...And here's where I stopped, (over)thinking... What *truly* defines *me*, my *identity*?

<h5 style="text-align: justify"> Studying at university surely does, as I fully identify with the pursuit of my passion as a career, the open-mindedness and cultural research I find typical of college-grade students. And surely also where I grew up in the past and where I'm growing up now do play a significant role in shaping me as a person... but what else does? Let's try not to get too formal and stay simple: defining a person is clearly a complex task, which requires a number of elements. Of course, if we exclude human-made codes, it could be perfectly accomplished by single elements such as **one's complete genome,** but cold hard science isn't always the answer and this is one of those times -- unless you like a whole shelf worth of books only filled with A, T, C and G. So, a handful of the first possible fragments that come to my mind are my:</h5>
-	Experiences
-	Achievements
-	Ambitions
-	Culture
-	Personality
-	Beliefs

Of the first two -- along with some of the others -- you can find a quite meaningless compendium in the "code" above -- along with some more fun facts -- but CV's don't really make people so we'll have to refer to the remaining as our main tools.

Now, grasping any person's culture, personality or beliefs in form of mere text is no easy task, and definitely outside of the scope of this page: perhaps you'll manage to get a glimpse of those by exploring the whole site.
And as for the goals, you can find what ambitions I'm currently pursuing in the [Now](/now) page -- as I do firmly believe that defining a person should imply a time factor.

### So, let me tell you about myself -- really.

Other than a student...

# I am a man of sea.
I've had the immense luck of being born in the beautiful city of [Genova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa), whose history of sailing and seamanship is long and rich enough to be hometown to [Cristoforo Colombo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus).
My father passed his life-long passion for the sea from our ancestors on to me, and the connection I feel with the water lives on in me to this day, and grows stronger every moment: I've been [SCUBA diving](/ama) since I was 9, and every time I dive I'm as fascinated as the first time.
Not even having practised figure ice-skating for about 5 years managed to draw me back from the sea: back in my hometown, the ice rink was literally right in the middle of the sea -- it's actually the second biggest such rink in the world, after Sydney's.

Nevertheless, I feel strongly attached to the earth too: the beautiful name my parents graced me with means ["worker of the earth"](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=george+etymology) and, while feeling a connection only based on a given name would indeed sound quite "astrology-esque", for me it's been nothing more than a starting point for my reflections.
And in the end, there's nobody happier to see land than a veteran sailor.

# I am a maker.
Every time I tinker with electronics and software, or prototype some change to whatever project I'm working on, I experience a very deep joy in **making** things: not just getting a piece done and working, but actually **crafting** it with my own hands.
This time around too, I come from a familiar tradition of tinkerers -- as a child, I used to call my granddad *"l'aggiustiero"*, a made-up word roughly translatable with *the fixer* -- and I feel a strong vocation for making things, crafting them with care.
While it would objectively be foolish to disregard the extreme impact the industrialisation process had -- and still has -- on our society, trying to fight it would be equally as foolish, given the global scale it's reached.
However, I find that peacefully acknowledging it is the first step towards acting on it: with the ever-increasing size of the industrial sector, both in number and in capillarity, I feel my vocation as a maker as a mean for achieving a greater balance both in the world and in me as an individual.

# I am passionate about culture in its every form.
I have grown to have a very deep passion for culture, in all its forms: art, philosophy, literature, poetry, theatre, music -- you name it, I'm fond of it. Mind you, I'm obviously not an expert in any of those fields, but although that might prevent me from having valid strong opinions in regard, it surely can't prevent me from appreciating and being passionate about them.

Take a look at my (loose) reviews [here](/categories).

# I think by links and analogies.
My education and possibly, to a certain extent, my natural disposition have developed my mindset to be particularly reactive to the **links** and the **analogies** between topics or subjects, which can sometimes even be very different and seemingly unrelated.
I find this trait neither good nor bad by itself: just characteristic of myself and the way I approach the world, which I believe to be extremely complex and full of such elements.

As featured on [Why](/why), writing this page proved to be the stimulating beginning of an elightening journey of self-discovery.
And as I continue in my journey, I'll be glad to have you alongside me, to share who I am as I find it out.
I hope to see you around!
