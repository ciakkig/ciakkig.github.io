As featured on [Now](/now) and [Why](/why), the moment I built this site was exactly when I started stepping out of social networks.
Since then, I have been fondly exploring this more authentic part of the Internet made of truly personal spaces and truly human connections.

# So, these are the personal spaces I find the most interesting and inspiring:

-   **[rcastellotti.dev](https://rcastellotti.dev):** my friend **Roberto Castellotti** definitely deserves the first spot on this list for being the single biggest inspiration for creating my own blog in the first place.
It was also him to introduce me to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the SSG that powers this website.   
My favourite part of his website is the live-typing description on the homepage: it draws attention in a very smooth way; however, it's far from reflecting his WPM count.
Go check it out, it recently got a new, fresh look thanks to the recent overhaul -- now in English!

-   **[sivers.org](https://sivers.org):** founder of CDBaby and HostBaby, fellow introvert and world citizen **Derek Sivers** has quickly grown to be one of my biggest inspirations, from his simple yet fresh idea of the ["Now page"](https://nownownow.com/about) to a concept of minimalism that embraces much, much more than its mere aesthetic aspect.    
My favourite part of his website is the permalink scheme: no subdirectories, only few letter slugs for a clean and truly minimal navigation of the site.

-   **[scottmathson.com](https://scottmathson.com):** web developer, designer and fellow maker **Scott Mathson** is the mind behind the [minimal theme](https://scottmathson.com/blog/2017/04/27/developing-a-jekyll-website-theme) you're seeing this site dressed in right now -- even though this exact version actually underwent my modifications...   
My favourite part of his website is the custom greeting on the homepage, that changes to be a consistent alliteration with each day of the week.

-   **[0x0f0f0f.github.io](https://0x0f0f0f.github.io):** programmer and fellow Computing Science student **Alessandro Cheli** has one of the most eye-candy minimal blogs I've ever seen, and makes really inspiring and diverse content.    
My favourite part of his website is the smoothly blinking cursor on the home link: really a fresh touch of colour and life.

-   **[pupp3r.net](https://pupp3r.net):** this one kind of counts for two -- I first came in contact with this website by seeing a sticker with its link on [a friend of mine](https://fork-bombed.github.io)'s laptop lid. And while I don't really know this person or even who they actually are, I can safely say their website builds on a very smart idea: a self-hosted platform scattered with security puzzles to solve and free to point all sorts of tools to.   
That's definitely my favourite thing about that website: this "meta-website" approach is something I find really original and playful.
