# Why did you make this website?

The single biggest inspiration for building this blog has definitely been my friend **Roberto Castellotti**'s own website, which he made as a repository for both his *projects* and his *thoughts*: a place to express himself in a truly free manner.
He does explain it in more detail, though: check out his space [here](https://rcastellotti.dev) -- but be wary: it's written in Italian.

Not long after he published his own website, I started stepping out of social networks.
As featured on [Now](/now), I increasingly felt like mainstream social networks such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter were the home of *unauthentic* self-expression, in its philosophical sense: a place for people to value how they *appear* instead of who they *are*, to unhealthily show off -- more on what exactly I mean [here](https://royby.com/philosophy/pages/dasein.html) and [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/authenticity).
Instead, I was looking for a place to express myself in a much more *authentic* way, free from the mediocre crowd that haunts social networks.
So, I started stepping out of them: first came Instagram, then Twitter -- and meanwhile, leaning towards a personal blog as the new expressive platform I was craving.

And creating this blog has really brought me many, many benefits along the way.
Along with the perfect space for self-expression, it also proved to be a surprising path of self-discovery: having to *write* out information about myself forced me to dig deeper into my identity, to exactly rule out what defines me -- as featured on [About](/about).
Moreover, this whole project has been extremely impactful on my technical knowledge and skill about websites and web design: being a student in Computer Science too, building this blog with a service like Squarespace or Wix would have meant wasting a chance to push my boundaries and learn from it; on the other hand, taking advantage of a content management system like Wordpress wouldn't have allowed me the flexibility I wanted for my beginner's website.
