-   **Focusing on my studies:** pursuing my interests in [Electronic and Software Engineering](https://www.gla.ac.uk/undergraduate/degrees/electronicsoftwareengineering/) at university takes up a significant part of my time and energy, as I find unsurprising for a student.

-   **Contributing to the work of my team at [Handprints e-NABLE Scotland](https://handprintsenable.com):** as soon as I got around university, I joined this amazing engineering society -- the Scottish instance of the global [e-NABLE](http://enablingthefuture.org) movement -- as part of the [Myoelectrics division](https://handprintsenable.com/myoelectric-project); however, I've never managed to actually work on any project -- yet. With the new semester, now that I'm a little more used to the life than the first time I came, I plan on contributing much more actively to the inspiring work of my team.

-   **Working on my main electronics project of an Arduino IoT personal weather station:** this one hits hard. I've been intermittently working on this project for about *3 years*, but now I'm closer than ever to actually completing it and deploying it for good. Next update -- hopefully a blog post along with an [Instructables](https://instructables.com) tutorial -- next time I come back to Italy, around March. I promise.

-   **Tinkering with GNU/Linux as my main OS:** I've been running almost exclusively on the Ubuntu-based distro [Pop!_OS](https://system76.com/pop) since September 2019, and Linux has so far proven to be a great tool for expanding my knowledge of computer science, thanks to its directness and open-source philosophy. It was my friend [Roberto Castellotti](http://rcastellotti.dev) who convinced me to ditch Windows and make the switch!

-   **Nourishing my relationships with friends and family:** I find relationships with other fellow humans one of the things that make [life worth living](http://www.leopardi.it/canti34.php). Right now, living out of my hometown enables me to get to know amazing people from all around the world, while visiting my friends and family when I'm back in my hometown proves so immensely heart-warming.

-   **Stepping out of social networks:** I have recently deactivated my Instagram account, as I found it an unhealthy place and the home of *unathenticity*, in its philosophical sense -- more on what exactly I mean [here](http://royby.com/philosophy/pages/dasein.html) and [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/authenticity). I take great pride in never having used Facebook -- the worst of them all in terms of fakeness -- and my Twitter account will probably follow very soon, as it's already been running unchecked for several months; the only social network I plan on keeping is [Reddit](https://reddit.com).

-   **Building this website:** my personal space on the Internet has been online since Monday January 20, 2020, and I've been finding it a great platform for expressing myself in a healthy and authentic way -- yes, exactly the opposite of social networks. Contrarily to what some may think, I firmly believe having ["A room of one's own"](https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/roomofonesown/summary/) encourages a much more balanced expression of oneself, as opposed to the "confrontational" mindset that rules social network feeds. And I've been fondly exploring this original, authentic -- yet for me newfound -- *social* part of the Internet made up of "rooms of one's own", truly personal spaces connected by truly human relationships, instead of passive, bland relationships inside of someone else's framework that promises a place for personal expression only as a bait for profit. I credit my favourite blogs [here](/favblogs).

-   **Trying to get into reading -- again, and more consistently:** since high school, my relationship with reading has proven... Quite unstable to say the least, but I find the switch to university very promising. I'm currently reading *[L'existentialisme est un humanisme](https://www.litcharts.com/lit/existentialism-is-a-humanism/summary-and-analysis)* by [Jean-Paul Sartre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre). Expect a review: coming soon!

-   **Getting into videography:** filmmaking has always kind of been a running passion in my family, and I've been feeling increasingly drawn to it for about a year. I've recently put together my first underwater videography edit, which you can find more about [here](/video).

-   **Striving to build the habit of meditating:** I have recently found out about [Headspace](https://headspace.com), tried it out and found myself really inspired by the ever-so-slight improvement in my (barely existing) **mindfulness**, along with a constant shift in my perception of the world I'm finding really positive. If you're interested, feel free to sign up [here](https://headspace.com/invite/pabVfxz) for 2 weeks of Pro plan for free -- and no, this isn't a sponsored ad: I just find sharing what we are enthusiastic about a basic natural element of wholesome human interactions. If you do, add me as a meditation buddy [here](https://hdsp.co/buddy/request/pabVfxz/0NzcAZ).

-   **Progressing my practice of aikido:** since I got into this martial art in September thanks to my father, I've found myself really passionate about its practice as both a physical and mental exercise. And since I left my hometown dojo -- which I've lately paid a lovely visit to -- I miss its style every time I practise, but I have a plan to fix this.

-   **Pursuing my latest dream of embarking on a campaign at sea with [Sea Shepherd Global](https://seashepherdglobal.org):** I've been caressing this idea for quite a long while now, but now more than ever I find it the only real solution to my longing for true adventure, my life-long love for the sea and my will to directly act to protect the environment.

-   **Trying to go vegetarian more consistently and healthily:** I've been trying to make the shift since I left for university, but my lazy relationship with food and especially cooking hasn't really proved helpful so far. Hopefully I can get inspiration from something along the lines of [r/EatCheapAndHealthy](https://www.reddit.com/r/eatcheapandhealthy) to be more consistent and healthy in my habit.
