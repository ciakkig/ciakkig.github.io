As featured on [Now](/now) and [Why](/why), the point in time I built this site was exactly the moment I started stepping out of social networks. Since then, I have been fondly exploring this more authentic part of the Internet made of truly personal spaces and truly human connections.

# So, these are the personal spaces I find the most interesting and inspiring:

-   **[rcastellotti.dev](http://rcastellotti.dev):** my friend **Roberto Castellotti** definitely deserves the first spot on this list for being the single biggest inspiration for creating this blog in the first place.
It was also him that directed me towards [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the SSG that powers this website.
My absolutely favourite part of his website is its unmistakably unapologetic style, totally in line with his personality.
Do check it out, but be wary: it's written in Italian.

-   **[sivers.org](http://sivers.org):** founder of CDBaby and HostBaby, fellow introvert and world citizen **Derek Sivers** has quickly grown to be one of my biggest inspirations, from his simple yet fresh idea of the ["Now page"](http://nownownow.com/about) to a concept of minimalism that embraces much, much more than its mere design aspect.
My absolutely favourite part of his website is his permalink scheme: no subdirectories, only few letter slugs for a clean and truly minimal navigation of the site.

-   **[scottmathson.com](https://scottmathson.com):** web developer, designer and fellow maker **Scott Mathson** is the mind behind the [minimal theme](https://scottmathson.com/blog/2017/04/27/developing-a-jekyll-website-theme) you're seeing this site dressed in right now.
My absolutely favourite part of his website is the custom greeting on the homepage, that changes to be a consistent alliteration with each day of the week.

-   **[0x0f0f0f.github.io](https://0x0f0f0f.github.io):** programmer and fellow Computer Science student **Alessandro Cheli** has one of the most eye-candy minimal blogs I've ever seen.
My absolutely favourite part of his website is the smoothly blinking cursor on the homelink: really a fresh touch of colour and life.
