# [ciakkig.github.io](https://ciakkig.github.io) (or [gggeo.tech](https://gggeo.tech))

This is the repository that hosts all the source material for my blog: anything you see on it which isn't a link, is here somewhere.
Here you'll find the raw Markdown manuscripts of all [pages](https://github.com/ciakkig/ciakkig.github.io/blob/master/pages) and [posts](https://github.com/ciakkig/ciakkig.github.io/blob/master/posts), the HTML and CSS code that sets the layout and styling of the site, and much more: all the modified photos are accompanied by their original versions, the "G" Logo is available as PNG and SVG along with ICO, and there are this README and a [LICENSE](#licenses) for details and legals.

The only thing you won't find here is the generator itself, which here on GitHub is handled behind the scenes by **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).**
But fear not: that's obviously open source too!
If you're *that* nosy, check out [its own repo](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).


## Theme

The website is built upon the Jekyll theme [Simpol](https://simpol.scottmathson.com) by [Scott Mathson](https://scottmathson.com).

My own version, however, is continuously undergoing slight changes.
I am not a web developer, let alone designer -- I just like to customise it to make it my own, as one does with free software.
I try to apply good coding practices to this too, but I'm not editing it with a "template" mindset: I modify it to complement the kind of content I post and how I want to offer it, regardless of others' tastes.

That being said if, by any chance, you like this one better than the original and want to use it for your own website, let me know: I'll do my best to strip it of my content, be more thoughtful of diverse scenarios and make a blank slate available as a proper fork of the original.


## Credits

Massive thanks to **[Roberto Castellotti](https://rcastellotti.dev)** for being the single biggest inspiration for building this website in the first place: without his contribute, who knows if it would even exist.    
And massive thanks to **[fork-bombed](https://fork-bombed.github.io)** as well, for making my day when I ended up at the other end of the inspiration chain!

Huge thanks to **Scott Mathson** for making this very theme and providing a canvas for my expression.

And thanks to Fedora Beelke for bearing with me during the ["G" Logo](https://github.com/ciakkig/ciakkig.github.io/blob/master/assets/logo) design process!

And last, but definitely not least, thanks to everyone who enjoys my content and supports me with enthusiastic feedback or, possibly better yet, constructive criticism.
